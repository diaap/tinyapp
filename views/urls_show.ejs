<!--
Using EJS and HTML, code your urls_index.ejs file to display the following:
A list or table of the URLs and their shortened forms.
A link for shortening a new URL (this will be a dead link for now, that is it doesn't need to go anywhere since you'll be building its functionality later


//We start by extending at the urls_show.ejs template to include a form with two elements â€“ a text input and a button.

Similar to the previous exercise, where you implemented URL deleting, the form will submit using a POST request.

Add a form to the urls_show template that submits an updated long URL
