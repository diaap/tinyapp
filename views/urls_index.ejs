<!--
Using EJS and HTML, code your urls_index.ejs file to display the following:
A list or table of the URLs and their shortened forms.
A link for shortening a new URL (this will be a dead link for now, that is it doesn't need to go anywhere since you'll be building its functionality later

within action - how you get the short url
